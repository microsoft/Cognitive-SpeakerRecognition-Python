# Microsoft Speaker Recognition API: Python Sample
This repo contains Python samples to demonstrate the use of Microsoft Speaker Recognition API, an offering within [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services), formerly known as Project Oxford.
* [Learn about the Speaker Recognition API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speaker-recognition-api)
* [Read the documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speaker-recognition-api/documentation)
* [Find more SDKs & Samples](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/SDK-Sample?api=speaker%20recognition)

## Run the Sample
First, you must obtain a free Speaker Recognition API subscription key by [following the instructions on our website](<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up>).

To use this sample application, there are four different scenarios:
 1. Create a user profile: `python Identification\CreateProfile.py <subscription_key>`
 2. Print all user profiles: `python Identification\PrintAllProfiles.py <subscription_key>`
 3. Enroll user profiles: `python Identification\EnrollProfile.py <subscription_key> <profile_id> <enrollment_file_path>`
 4. Identify test files: `python Identification\IdentifyFile.py <subscription_key> <identification_file_path> <profile_ids>...`

Microsoft will receive the audio files you upload and may use them to improve Speaker Recognition API and related services. By submitting an audio, you confirm you have consent from everyone in it.
